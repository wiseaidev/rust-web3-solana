    "In [the previous chapter](https://github.com/wiseaidev/rust-web3-solana/tree/main/chapter-2), we have taken a look at [the event queue](https://github.com/wiseaidev/rust-web3-solana/tree/main/chapter-2#22-market-eventrequest-queues-) which handles the asynchronous process of managing all the fills that occur when trades happen. Whenever you place a new order on the book, you have to transfer some tokens to OpenBook, say WSOL or USDC, and whenever you make a trade, some tokens will transfer from locked state to freed state. Locked quantity and locked free quantity either [**base**](https://github.com/openbook-dex/program/blob/c85e56deeaead43abbc33b7301058838b9c5136d/dex/src/state.rs#L594-L595) or [**quote tokens**](https://github.com/openbook-dex/program/blob/c85e56deeaead43abbc33b7301058838b9c5136d/dex/src/state.rs#L597-L598) will [**increment**](https://github.com/openbook-dex/program/blob/c85e56deeaead43abbc33b7301058838b9c5136d/dex/src/state.rs#L637) and [**decrement**](https://github.com/openbook-dex/program/blob/c85e56deeaead43abbc33b7301058838b9c5136d/dex/src/state.rs#L648) based on the position that occurs.\n",

    "Event queues in a DEX play a crucial role in managing the lifecycle of orders. They ensure that all events such as order placements, trades, and cancellations are processed in a sequential and efficient manner.
